# Working on this repo

This is **the** Degen Emporium site. An older multi-page site existed before
it and has been retired completely. Build only on what's here.

## Never bring back the old site

- The site is the Degen City homepage (`src/pages/index.astro`), the Emporium
  comic page it links into (`src/pages/emporium.astro`) and `404.astro`. Do not
  add or restore pages like `/news`, `/blog`, `/store`, `/shop`, `/alpha`,
  `/tokenomics`, `/vault`, `/terminal`, `/team`, `/projects`, `/about`,
  `/contact` or `/links` unless the owner asks for that page by name.
- Do not restore anything from git history (old pages, art, team portraits,
  graffiti headers, sticker sheets, the acid-green palette, the "Connect"
  wallet button, the "MAINNET" badge). Old commits are history, not source.
- New pages, sections or art only on the owner's explicit request.
- The `nft-minter` branch is a separate project. Never merge it, or copy
  anything from it, into `main` or any website branch.

## Design rules

- The homepage is an isometric night city drawn as one SVG at build time by
  `src/lib/city.ts`: black ink outlines, flat cartoon shading, PulseChain
  neon. Each linked building is an `<a class="spot">` with a matching pin;
  links and pin copy live in `src/components/CityMap.astro`. Buildings link
  only to `/emporium` (or one of its window anchors: `#drop`, `#workshop`,
  `#vault`, `#plan`) or to the confirmed links in `src/data/site.ts`.
- Keep the city's motion optional: CSS animations stop under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`, and the script pauses the SMIL traffic.
- The comic-window layout in `src/components/ComicPage.astro` is the design.
  Each window is defined by its ink outline; keep content inside the slants.
- Palette is the PulseChain gradient. Follow `brand/README.md`: gradient for
  borders, glows and large type; `--p-cyan` for small text; buttons are
  gradient-bordered with white text, never gradient-filled.
- Type: Big Shoulders Display (headlines), Inter (body), JetBrains Mono
  (labels).
- Check every change at 320, 375, 768, 1024 and 1440px wide: no sideways
  scroll, no text clipped by a slanted edge.

## Content guardrails

- **The token is confidential until launch.** Never put its name, ticker,
  contract address or launch details in the site's markup, alt text, meta
  tags, file names or commit messages. Window 05 shows a blurred *decoy*:
  CSS blur only hides things visually, and the HTML is public. Reveal it
  only when the owner says launch is live.

- All copy is draft until the owner says otherwise; keep the draft note.
- No prices, stats, APYs, audits, partnerships or testimonials unless the
  owner supplies them as facts. No financial advice.
- PulseChain is a real project: say "PulseChain native", never imply an
  official partnership or endorsement.
- Only link to destinations the owner has confirmed (currently X, Telegram
  and the Shopify store in `src/data/site.ts`).
- The Shopify store is public too: anything the site pulls from it (product
  names, images, descriptions) must not reveal the token either.
